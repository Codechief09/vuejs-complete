There are two branches:

- `master` is the completed source code
- `getting-started` is the minimal template to follow along from start

## Installation

I am using:

- node.js v12.18.3
- yarn 1.22.10

You can use whatever version, but I have only tested with those versions. Don't use yarn 2, it's really different to yarn 1.

`master` contains the completed code. Run projects with:

```
yarn vite --config vite.config.js <project>
```

## Getting Started

Either clone master and `yarn install`, or start with `getting-started` and:

```sh
yarn add vue@3.0.7
yarn add vite@2.1.1 --dev
```
